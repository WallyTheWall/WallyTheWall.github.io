--- WTF IS THIS PLACE? ---

This is a site I put up just because I can, seeing as my ISP doesn't
block port 80. Lots of people have their ports blocked and I'd hate to
waste this opportunity!

EDIT: I upgraded to a faster service but they stuck me behind a double
NAT and now I can't forward ports at all. Hello darkness my old friend.

But mostly, I just wanted to fuck around with some (incredibly basic)
HTML because why not. If you're reading this, then I've already
exceeded the amount of visitors I expected on this site.

--- WTF IS ON THIS PIECE OF SHIT? ---

There's nothing really here. We've got the official unofficial page
for BFG(ded); a list of all the mongolian slideshows I watched or am
currently watching, so you can bask in the glory that is my horrendous
taste; my dank ebin mail account and my PGP public key which I suspect
neither will never be used; and there's a link to my Steam profile.
There's also some half-decent meme music I rotate on a whenever-I-feel
-like-it basis.

All the other things aren't mine, they're just interesting things I
link to. I take no credit, so please don't sue my ass. Any Lain images
on the homepage aren't mine, I take no credit for them.

--- WTF ARE YOU? ---

An Argie raised in the US with a serious case of freedom-withdrawl
syndrome ever since I came back. I play the vidya (badly) and watch
the moe. That's about as much as you need to know. Call me Westwall.
Or Wally, Wally the Wall. I tend to stick a bunch of shit right before
the "Wall" part, too, ie. "Wally the Whitewall".

--- WTF IS THIS WEEB SHIT? ---

Love Lain, or get out. 2 sugoi 2 live; 2 kawaii 2 die.
